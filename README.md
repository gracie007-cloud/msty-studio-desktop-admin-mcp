# 🍍 Msty Admin MCP

**AI-Powered Administration for Msty Studio Desktop**

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that transforms Claude into an intelligent system administrator for [Msty Studio Desktop](https://msty.ai). Query databases, manage configurations, orchestrate local AI models, and build tiered AI workflows—all through natural conversation.

## What is This?

Msty Admin MCP lets you manage your entire Msty Studio installation through Claude Desktop. Instead of clicking through menus or manually editing config files, just ask Claude:

> "Show me my Msty personas and suggest improvements"

> "Compare my local models on a coding task"

> "Run calibration tests to see which model handles reasoning best"

> "What's the health status of my Msty installation?"

Claude handles the rest—querying databases, calling APIs, analysing results, and presenting actionable insights.

---

## Use Cases

### 🔍 **1. Database Inspection & Insights**
Query your Msty database directly through conversation. Access conversations, personas, prompts, knowledge stacks, and MCP tools without touching SQLite.

```
"Show me all my Msty personas"
"How many conversations do I have?"
"List my configured MCP tools"
```

### 🏥 **2. Health Monitoring & Diagnostics**
Comprehensive health checks for your Msty installation—database integrity, storage usage, model cache status, and actionable recommendations.

```
"Check the health of my Msty installation"
"Is Sidecar running?"
"How much storage are my models using?"
```

### ⚙️ **3. Configuration Sync Between Claude & Msty**
Export MCP tool configurations from Claude Desktop and prepare them for Msty import. Generate personas from templates. Convert your Claude preferences to Msty format.

```
"Export my Claude Desktop MCP tools"
"Generate an Opus-style persona for Msty"
"Sync my preferences to Msty format"
```

### 🤖 **4. Local Model Orchestration**
Direct integration with Msty's Sidecar API. Chat with local models, compare responses across models, and get hardware-aware recommendations.

```
"List my available local models"
"Chat with qwen2.5:7b about Python async"
"Which model is best for coding on my hardware?"
```

### 📊 **5. Performance Analytics**
Track tokens per second, latency, and error rates across your local models. Privacy-respecting conversation analytics. Identify usage patterns.

```
"How fast are my local models?"
"Show performance metrics for the last 30 days"
"Which model has the best success rate?"
```

### 🎯 **6. Model Calibration & Quality Testing**
Test your local models against standardised prompts across categories (reasoning, coding, writing, analysis, creative). Score response quality. Track improvement over time.

```
"Run calibration tests on my Qwen model"
"Test my models on reasoning tasks"
"Show my calibration history"
```

### 🔄 **7. Tiered AI Workflow (Claude + Local)**
Identify which tasks your local models handle well and which should escalate to Claude. Build efficient hybrid workflows where simple tasks go local and complex tasks go to Claude.

```
"What tasks should I hand off to Claude?"
"Identify patterns where local models fail"
"Compare Claude vs local on this task"
```

### 🔬 **8. Database Discovery (Advanced)**
Through this MCP, we discovered Msty's internal database structure at:
```
~/Library/Application Support/MstyStudio/File System/000/t/00/00000000
```

This SQLite database contains tables for:
- `personas` - Your configured personas
- `tools` - MCP tool configurations
- `toolConfigs` - Tool parameters
- `conversationTexts` - Chat history
- `knowledgeStacks` - RAG configurations
- And more...

**Note**: Direct database manipulation is possible when Msty is closed, but unsupported. Use at your own risk.

### Data Storage

| Location | Purpose |
|----------|--------|
| Msty Database | Read-only queries (conversations, personas, etc.) |
| `~/.msty-admin/` | MCP's own metrics and calibration data |

The MCP never writes to Msty's database—it only reads. All metrics and calibration results are stored separately.

---

## Hardware Recommendations

### For Basic Use (Inspection, Health Checks)
- Any Mac with Msty installed
- No local models required

### For Local Model Features
| RAM | Recommended Models | Quality |
|-----|-------------------|--------|
| 8GB | qwen2.5:3b, gemma3:4b | Basic |
| 16GB | qwen2.5:7b, qwen2.5-coder:7b | Good |
| 32GB | qwen2.5:14b, llama3.1:8b | Very Good |
| 64GB+ | qwen2.5:32b, mixtral:8x7b | Excellent |
| 128GB+ | qwen2.5:72b, llama3.1:70b | Near-Claude |

### Performance Expectations (Apple Silicon)

| Model | M1 Pro 16GB | M2 Max 64GB | M3 Max 128GB |
|-------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| 7B | 30-45 tok/s | 50-70 tok/s | 60-80 tok/s |
| 14B | Slow | 30-45 tok/s | 45-60 tok/s |
| 32B | ❌ | 15-25 tok/s | 25-40 tok/s |
| 70B | ❌ | ❌ | 10-20 tok/s |

## FAQ

### General

**Q: Do I need Msty Studio Desktop installed?**  
A: Yes. This MCP is specifically designed to administer Msty Studio. Without it, most tools won't function.

**Q: Does this work on Windows or Linux?**  
A: Currently macOS only. Msty Studio Desktop is a macOS application.

**Q: Is my data safe?**  
A: The MCP only reads from Msty's database—it never writes to it. Metrics and calibration data are stored separately in `~/.msty-admin/`. No data is sent externally.

### Local Models

**Q: Do I need local models installed?**  
A: For basic features (database queries, health checks), no. For local model features (chat, compare, calibrate), you need Msty Sidecar running with at least one model.

**Q: Which local models work best?**  
A: Use `recommend_model` with your use case. Generally:
- **Coding**: qwen2.5-coder (7B or 32B depending on your RAM)
- **General**: qwen2.5 (7B for speed, 32B for quality)
- **Fast responses**: gemma3:4b or qwen3:0.6b

**Q: What's the Sidecar?**  
A: Msty Sidecar is the background service that hosts local models. It provides an Ollama-compatible API on port 11964.

**Q: Can local models use MCP tools?**  
A: Yes, but smaller models (7B and below) often struggle with complex tool orchestration. Models 14B+ handle tools much better. For reliable MCP tool usage, consider 32B+ models or stick with Claude for complex workflows.

### Calibration

**Q: What is calibration?**  
A: Calibration tests your local models against standardised prompts to measure quality. Categories include reasoning, coding, writing, analysis, and creative tasks.

**Q: What's a good calibration score?**  
A: Scores range 0.0-1.0. Generally:
- 0.8+ = Excellent
- 0.6-0.8 = Good (passes threshold)
- 0.4-0.6 = Fair
- Below 0.4 = Poor

**Q: What are handoff triggers?**  
A: Patterns that indicate a task should be handled by Claude instead of a local model. The MCP learns these from failed calibration tests.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: Claude doesn't see the msty-admin tools**  
A: Check your `claude_desktop_config.json` paths are absolute (not relative). Restart Claude Desktop after changes.

**Q: "Sidecar not running" error**  
A: Start Msty Sidecar from the Msty Studio menu bar icon, or ensure Msty is open.

**Q: "Database not found" error**  
A: Msty stores its database in `~/Library/Application Support/MstyStudio/File System/000/t/00/00000000`. Ensure Msty has been launched at least once.

**Q: Model comparison takes too long**  
A: Each model runs sequentially. Limit comparisons to 3-5 models. Larger models (32B+) take longer.
